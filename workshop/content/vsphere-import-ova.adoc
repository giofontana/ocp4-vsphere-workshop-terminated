#### Import OVA Template

[NOTE]
====
Note 1: To save time, this OVA is has been already imported. The steps below is for reference only, use the template that is in "ocp-template" folder and skip the steps below.

Note 2: *NEVER, NEVER, NEVER start up the template*. The ignition process runs on first boot, so booting the template would mean any ignition files provided after that wouldn't be evaluated.
====

Navigate to “VMs and Templates” (it’s the icon that looks like a piece of paper). From here right click on your datacenter and select New Folder → New VM and Template Folder. Name this new folder the name of your cluster id: ocp<GUID>
